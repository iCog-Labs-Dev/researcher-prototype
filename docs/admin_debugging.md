# Admin Console & Debugging Tools

## 1. Admin Console (React)

The admin UI is bundled inside the front-end build and accessible at `/admin`.

### Login

```
POST /admin/login   { "password": "<ADMIN_PASSWORD>" }
```

Credentials come from the backend `.env`:

```
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123               # change in production!
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=super-secret-string
ADMIN_JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=480
```

After logging in the JWT is stored in `localStorage`; subsequent requests add `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Features

| Section | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Prompt Editor** | View & edit system / node prompts with version history and live test run |
| **Flow Visualiser** | Fetches generated PNG/SVG diagrams of the LangGraph and research flow |
| **Status Panel** | Quick health checks (OpenAI key, Zep memory, research engine status) |

#### Prompt version control

Every time you press **Save** in the Prompt Editor the server writes a timestamped backup of the previous content to `backend/storage_data/prompts/`.  These backups are **not** part of the Git repo, so you can experiment freely.  Use the *History* button in the UI to compare, restore or download earlier versions.

Restoring a version simply copies it over the active prompt – older backups remain intact.

To regenerate diagrams on-demand (saved to `backend/static/diagrams/`):

```
POST /admin/flows/diagrams/generate?force_regenerate=true  # regenerate even if cached
```

## 2. Debug Endpoints (Research)

All routes live under `/research/debug/*` and do **not** require admin auth – use responsibly.

* `GET  /motivation/topic-scores/{user_id}` – inspect current topic scores and priorities
* `POST /motivation/topic-scores` – create or update topic scores
* `GET  /motivation/config/{user_id}` – view motivation configuration
* `POST /research/debug/active-topics` – list active topics for all users

## 3. Knowledge Graph Debug

* `POST /api/graph/fetch` – fetch graph data for a user
  - Request body: `{"type": "user", "id": "user-id"}`
  - Returns triplets (nodes + edges + relationships)

Common issues:
- Empty graphs: User needs conversations to populate Zep
- "Zep service unavailable": Check `ZEP_API_KEY` and `ZEP_ENABLED=true`

## 4. Logging & Tracing

* **Logging** – configurable via `logging_config.py`. Use `configure_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)` for verbose output.
* **LangSmith Tracing** – enable by setting `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` and API key.

## 5. Router Diagnostics in Chat UI

Every assistant message now includes a **Show Routing Info** link. Clicking it reveals a mini panel with:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Module | The path chosen by the router: **chat**, **search** or **analyzer** |
| Reason | Short natural-language explanation from the router model |
| Complexity | Estimated difficulty of the user request *(1-10)* |
| Router Model | The lightweight model (e.g. *gpt-4o-mini*) used for the routing decision |

This is invaluable when troubleshooting unexpected behaviour – you can instantly verify whether a message was routed to the correct module and why.

## 6. Visualising Graphs Locally

```bash
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate
python graph_builder.py              # creates static/diagrams/main_chat_flow.png
python research_graph_builder.py     # creates static/diagrams/research_flow.png
```

Graphviz must be installed (`sudo apt-get install graphviz`).
